           <p>As a child, Caroline contracted typhus which stunted her growth at four feet three inches. As a result, her family deemed her unmarriageable, denied her education, and raised her to believe that she wouldn't achieve nothing more than being a scullery maid.</p>
    </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="facts-content">
      <p>At first, Caroline did not have an interest in astronomy. At the age of 22, she moved to Bath, England to live with her brother, <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/240-years-ago-astronomer-william-herschel-identifies-uranus-as-the-seventh-planet">William Herschel </a>(who btw you should check out as well!!), and trained as a singer. She sang as a soprano in a number of performances. </p>

      <div class="facts-content">
      <p>It was thanks to William that Caroline learned English and Maths. At the time, he was an amateur astronomer, and his lessons allowed her to work as his assistant e.g. taking notes, polishing mirrors of his telescopes and executing calculations. Of course, it also allowed her to develop her own fascination with astronomy!</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="facts-content">
      <p>Caroline went onto discovering many more comets which now bear her name. For example, the asteroid 281 Lucretia is named after her second given name, and there is also a crater on the Moon named after her called C. Herschel!</p>
